> If your server CPU architecture is not `amd64`, replace `amd64` in the command with another architecture

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/

## Cloudflare CDN

Add a site:
[cloudflare ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/)

Manage DNS records:
[Create DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/)

## SSL certificate application

> This function and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

The script has a built-in SSL certificate application function. To use this script to apply for a certificate, the following conditions must be met:

- Know your Cloudflare registration email
- Know the Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

Create API token:
[cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)

How to get Cloudflare Global API Key:

    ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.png)

When using it, you only need to enter the `domain name`, `email`, and `API KEY`. The diagram is as follows:
        ![](media/2022-04-04_141259.png)

Things to note:

- This script uses the DNS API for certificate request
- Let's Encrypt is used as the CA party by default
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/cert directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all pan-domain certificates.
## Upgrade

 Mac - Windows - Android - Linux - IOS
<br>
+ How fast is this service?
 It depends on things like your internet provider host and distance and more

+ Does the use of V2RAY give any limitations?
In general, no, but you need to know what bandwidth and speed your host uses

+ Who is V2RAY suitable for?
It is suitable for personal use or small companies with few members and generally for those who are tired of internet censorship

+ Is there a limit to user creation?

In the user creation window, you can specify the date and volume of the Internet

+ Can V2RAY be used commercially?
Definitely not. V2RAY can only support a certain number of users. We do not advise you to do this because it will disrupt the service

Not necessarily. This depends on your host because some of them have banned the use of services without authentication

## Updates V2RAY

- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported-Ubuntu%20Server-ABFF4F)

## Migrating from v2-ui

First install the latest version of x-ui on the server where v2-ui is installed, and then use the following command to migrate. All inbound account data of the local v2-ui will be migrated to x-ui, and the panel settings and username and password will be migrated. Will not migrate`

> After the migration is successful, please `close v2-ui` and `restart x-ui`, otherwise the inbound of v2-ui will cause a `port conflict` with the inbound of x-ui`

```
x-ui v2-ui
```
